# Self Evaluation

1. How confident do you feel in your understanding and fluency with the comparison operators?
  I feel pretty confident in my use of them.

1. How confident do you feel in your understanding and fluency with the logical operators?
  I feel pretty good about the logical operators, too. I was in electronics, so it uses
  much of the logic in Boolean Algebra.

1. How confident do you feel in your understanding and fluency with the if statements?
   Pretty good, they seem to follow the same conventions as in other programs,
   such as Javascript, which I was getting exposed to in the part time Mod 0.

1. How much time did you spend on this lesson/topic? How did that line up with your time estimate?
   4 hours. I was thoroughly discouraged at myself for not working like a fiend earlier in the day.
   But, I did overcome a major hurdle: I think I may have selected the HTTPS choice and it asked
   for my password in setting up my cloned repository and I was denied. So, I created a new one
   in my GutHub account to save my work.

1. What do you still need to practice or learn? How will you do that? Do you need to adjust your calendar in order to do that?
   I need to just get better working with the Ruby language. I'm up past bedtime, so i'll need to budget my
   sleep/ work time...

1. What questions do you still have? How will you get the answers you need?
   I am trying to get better in GitHub, but happy I was able to do an alternate solution from what
   the assignment was... That is, using the cloned repository and pulling it into your local work-space.
   I feel that I struggled on issues with GitHub the first time, and am doing so again. I solved the problem, but I could only go "one direction", that is, from the GitHub procedure that we worked on in the class presentation and with the video... Going the other direction, that is, from the repository in GitHub that we were then to clone and save to our local machine, I think I mistakenly tried using HTTPS, as I didn't do
   the SSH one correctly? I'm not sure what I did, but it worked initially, at least enough for me to utilize the files and created a new repository for me to push them into.
